    This also works fine using `glucose` instead of `minisat`, or any

    Parameters
    ----------
    F  : a CNF formula
    
    cmd : string
        the command line used to invoke the SAT solver.

    verbose: int
       0 or less means no output. 1 shows the command line actually

    ---------
    _satsolve_filein_fileout(F,cmd='minisat -no-pre')
    _satsolve_filein_fileout(F,cmd='glucose -pre')

    The first call tests F using `minisat` without formula

    ------
    `minisat` writes its output on a file. If the formula is
    unsatisfiable then the output file contains just the line "UNSAT",
    but if it is satisfiable it contains the line "SAT" and on a new
    line the assignment, encoded as literal values, e.g., "-1 2 3 -4 -5 ..."

    Supported solvers:

    Drop-in solver replacements:
    ----------------------------

    It is possible to use any drop-in replacement for these solvers,
    but in this case more information is needed on how to communicate
    with the solver. In particular `minisat` does not respect
    the standard `dimacs` I/O conventions, and that holds also for
    `glucose` which is a drop-in replacement of `minisat`.

    For the supported solver we can pick the right interface, but for
    other solvers it is impossible to guess. We suggest to use one of
