def StoneFormula(D, nstones):
    """Stone formulas

    The stone formulas have been introduced in [2]_ and generalized in
    [1]_. They are one of the classic examples that separate regular
    resolutions from general resolution [1]_.

    A \"Stones formula\" from a directed acyclic graph :math:`D`
    claims that each vertex of the graph is associated with one on
    :math:`s` stones (not necessarily in an injective way).
    In particular for each vertex :math:`v` in :math:`V(D)` and each
    stone :math:`j` we have a variable :math:`P_{v,j}` that claims
    that stone :math:`j` is associated to vertex :math:`v`.

    Each stone can be either red or blue, and not both.
    The propositional variable :math:`R_j` if true when the stone
    :math:`j` is red and false otherwise.

    The clauses of the formula encode the following constraints.
    If a stone is on a source vertex (i.e. a vertex with no incoming
    edges), then it must be red. If all stones on the predecessors of
    a vertex are red, then the stone of the vertex itself must be red.

    The formula furthermore enforces that the stones on the sinks
    (i.e. vertices with no outgoing edges) are blue.

    .. note:: The exact formula structure depends by the graph and on
              its topological order, which is determined by the
              ``enumerate_vertices(D)``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    D : a directed acyclic graph
        it should be a directed acyclic graph.
    nstones : int
       the number of stones.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
       if :math:`D` is not a directed acyclic graph
    
    ValueError
       if the number of stones is negative

def SparseStoneFormula(D, B):
    """Sparse Stone formulas

    This is a variant of the :py:func:`StoneFormula`. See that for
    a description of the formula. This variant is such that each
    vertex has only a small selection of which stone can go to that
    vertex. In particular which stones are allowed on each vertex is
    specified by a bipartite graph :math:`B` on which the left
    vertices represent the vertices of DAG :math:`D` and the right
    vertices are the stones. 

    If a vertex of :math:`D` correspond to the left vertex :math:`v`
    in :math:`B`, then its neighbors describe which stones are allowed
    for it.

    The vertices in :math:`D` do not need to have the same name as the
    one on the left side of :math:`B`. It is only important that the
    number of vertices in :math:`D` is the same as the vertices in the
    left side of :math:`B`.

    In that case the element at position :math:`i` in the ordered
    sequence ``enumerate_vertices(D)`` corresponds to the element of
    rank :math:`i` in the sequence of left side vertices of
    :math:`B` according to the output of ``Left, Right =
    bipartite_sets(B)``.

    Standard :py:func:`StoneFormula` is essentially equivalent to
    a sparse stone formula where :math:`B` is the complete graph.
