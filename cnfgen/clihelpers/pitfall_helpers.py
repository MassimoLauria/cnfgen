    The Pitfall formula was designed to be specifically easy for
    Resolution and hard for common CDCL heuristics. The formula is
    unsatisfiable and consists of three parts: an easy formula, a hard
    formula, and a pitfall misleading the solver into working with the
    hard part.

    The hard part are several copies of an unsatisfiable Tseitin
    formula on a random regular graph. The pitfall part is made up of
    a few gadgets over (primarily) two sets of variables: pitfall
    variables, which point the solver towards the hard part after
    being assigned, and safety variables, which prevent the gadget
    from breaking even if a few other variables are assigned.

    For more details, see the corresponding paper by Marc Vinyals (AAAI 2020).

positional arguments:
 {0} v,d,ny,nz,k

 where:
 v    --- number of vertices of the Tseitin graph
 d    --- degree of the Tseitin graph
 ny   --- number of pitfall variables
 nz   --- number of safety variables
 k    --- number of copies of the hard and pitfall parts; controls how
          easy the easy part is
