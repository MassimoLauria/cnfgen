  [[https://travis-ci.org/MassimoLauria/cnfgen.svg?branch=master]]

  http://cnfgen.readthedocs.org/en/latest/?badge=latest
  
  This repository provides the command

  - =cnfgen= formula generator;

  and  the  following  python  scripts, designed  to  operate  from/to
  dimacs CNFs:

  - =cnfshuffle= random shuffler;

  - =cnftransform= apply litfing or substitution; 

  - =kthgraph2pebformula= make pebbling formula from a DAG.

  You  can get  a brief  help on  how to  use these  tools by  running
  =<program_name> --help= from the command line.

  Run =cnfgen --help= to get a list of the implemented formula families.
  To get  more specific information  on one  class of formula  use the
  command

  : cnfgen <formula_type> --help

  See the webpage of the project at http://massimolauria.github.io/cnfgen/

** Installation
   
   You can install CNFgen from  [[http://pypi.python.org][Python Package Index]], together with all
   its dependencies, typing either

   : easy_install [--user] cnfgen

   or

   : pip install  [--user] cnfgen

   Otherwise  it is  possible  to install  from  source, assuming  the
   requirements are already installed, using
   
   : python setup.py install [--user]

   The =--user= option allows to install  the package in the user home
   directory. If you do that please check that the target location for
   the command line utilities are in your $PATH.
